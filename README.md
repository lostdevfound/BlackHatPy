# BlackHatPy
A repository inspired by Justin Seitz's book Black Hat Python

The module contains netbh.py - command line tools which is similar to Netcat utility. Netbh.py runs on top of the module blackHatPy which has an API to create server and define their behavior functionality.
The API works on top of the SSL and self-signed certificates. The code comes with the test self-signed pem certificate and a private key.

In order to run the tool from the shell and see the help:
```
python bhnet.py  -h
```
